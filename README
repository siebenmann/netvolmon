Netvolmon is a Go program that reports on basic network volume
statistics (RX/TX bandwidth and packets, both per second) for one or
more network devices. It runs on Linux and Solaris and can timestamp
its output and do a few other tricks; see its usage information for
details.

There are many programs that do things like this (for example,
nicstat). This one is mine. It may be of interest as an example
of calling getifaddrs() from Go and using my (go-)kstat package[1]
to get access to Solaris/Illumos/OmniOS kstat(s).

(If history is any guide, it's going to grow various baroque options
over time.)
